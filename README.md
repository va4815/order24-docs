# Order24

Order24 is a food-ordering Point-of-Sale (POS) system that manages the end-to-end restaurant order journeyâ€”from self-ordering, through queuing and preparation, to hand-off. The system has two core entities: **Platform** and **Merchant**.

### Platform
The cloud-hosted control plane operated by the product owner. Platform administrators use it to onboard and manage all merchants, set global policies, and monitor operations.

### Merchant
An on-premises, merchant-hosted server that runs day-to-day restaurant operations, including menu setup, ordering, and kitchen workflows.
